> Note: I have deployed my own application, which has no tests to run, but I got the idea of running tests in the pipeline. I couldn't deploy udagram because it shows a huge amount of errors and there is no time to fix them as I have to finish the program before the 10th of January and I couldn't finish it earlier because of my university exams.
