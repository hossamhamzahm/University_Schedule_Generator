# University Schedule Generator

### Project Idea
This project focuses on building a schedule generator that generates all possible schedules for a prescribed list of courses entered by the user (using backtracking algorithm), then storing this list in a database. The generated schedules should have no conflicts or issues within it.

### Main objectives
    - Registering and saving users.
    - Saving all courses with their different sections, tutorials and labs.
    - Saving the different possible schedules that a user could have.
    - Retrieval of the available schedules to be viewed by the user whenever needed.
    - Ability to update courses’, users’, or professors' information.
